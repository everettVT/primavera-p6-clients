    P6 EPPM Rest API

    The Primavera P6 Enterprise Project Portfolio Management (P6 EPPM) API is a flexible interface to P6 EPPM functionality based on the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style. Clients can use HTTP enabled technologies to interact with the API and access application features. For example, you can write programs in Javascript, Java, and other languages to create users, view a list of users, update a user's status, or update user details.
