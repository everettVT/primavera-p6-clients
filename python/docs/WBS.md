**total_spending_plan** | **float** | The sum of the monthly spending plan. | [optional] 
**total_spending_plan_tally** | **float** | The sum of the monthly spending plan tally. | [optional] 
**unallocated_budget** | **float** | The difference between the total current and distributed current budget. Calculated as total current budget - distributed current budget. | [optional] 
**undistributed_current_variance** | **float** | The total spending plan minus the total spending plan tally. | [optional] 
**wbs_category_object_id** | **int** | The unique ID of the associated WBS category value. Note that the label used for the WBS category is dynamic; it is controlled by the system administrator. | [optional] 
**wbs_milestone_percent_complete** | **float** | The WBSMilestonePercentComplete field determines whether to calculate earned value by defining milestones at the WBS level and assigning a level of significance or weight to each of them. As progress occurs and you mark each milestone complete, the WBS element&#39;s performance percent complete is calculated based on the weight of the milestone. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.wbs import WBS

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of WBS from a JSON string
wbs_instance = WBS.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(WBS.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
wbs_dict = wbs_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of WBS from a dict
wbs_from_dict = WBS.from_dict(wbs_dict)
```
