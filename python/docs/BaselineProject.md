## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**activity_default_activity_type** | **str** | The default type for activities. Possible values are &#39;Task Dependent&#39;, &#39;Resource Dependent&#39;, &#39;Level of Effort&#39;, or &#39;Milestone&#39;. A &#39;Task Dependent&#39; activity is scheduled using the activity&#39;s calendar rather than the calendars of the assigned resources. A &#39;Resource Dependent&#39; activity is scheduled using the calendars of the assigned resources. This type is used when several resources are assigned to the activity, but they may work separately. A &#39;Milestone&#39; is a zero-duration activity without resources, marking a significant project event. A &#39;Level of Effort&#39; activity has a duration that is determined by its dependent activities. Administration-type activities are typically &#39;Level of Effort&#39;. | [optional]

**activity_id_suffix** | **int** | The suffix used for auto-numbering of activity IDs. When a new activity is created, the activity ID is automatically generated using auto-numbering. Activity ID auto-numbering concatenates the prefix and the suffix, with the suffix incremented to make the code unique.

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of BaselineProject from a JSON string
baseline_project_instance = BaselineProject.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(BaselineProject.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
baseline_project_dict = baseline_project_instance.to_dict()
